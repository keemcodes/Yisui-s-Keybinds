# Yisui-s-Keybinds
Everyone wanted my binds back in the day lol

# How
I used this thing called SA:MP UDF which helps autohotkey communicate with SA:MP's DLL. I could make single click proximity binds to guard nearest player. No having to put the ID in, thats ghetto. They didn't use to call me the hotkey god for nothing lol.
